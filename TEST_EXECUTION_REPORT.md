**Details:**
```
✓ lib/ai/text-splitter.test.ts (4 tests) 32ms
✓ lib/ai/tools/file-search.test.ts (5 tests) 7ms
✓ lib/ai/token-utils.test.ts (19 tests) 52ms
```

### 2. Database Tests (pgTAP) ❌
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Framework:** PostgreSQL + pgTAP
- **Issue:** Environment configuration and database connectivity problems
- **Root Causes:**
  - Environment variable mismatch: Script uses `DATABASE_URL` but migration expects `POSTGRES_URL`
  - Database container connectivity issues
  - Container lifecycle management problems
- **Test Database:** PostgreSQL 16 Alpine
- **Port:** 5433 (mapped from container port 5432)

**Error Details:**
- Database failed to become ready within timeout (30 attempts)
- Connection refused errors when attempting migration
- Migration script dependency on missing `tsx` module

### 3. End-to-End Tests (Playwright) ❌
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Framework:** Playwright
- **Test Configuration:** 20 tests across 5 projects
- **Issue:** Web server connectivity problems
- **Root Causes:**
  - Tests require running web server on localhost:3000
  - Connection refused when attempting to navigate to test pages
  - Authentication setup failing due to server unavailability
- **Test Projects:**
  - setup:auth (authentication setup)
  - setup:reasoning (reasoning setup)
  - chat (chat functionality)
  - reasoning (reasoning tests)
  - artifacts (artifacts tests)

**Error Details:**
```
Error: page.goto: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED at http://localhost:3000/
```

### 4. Build Process ❌
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Build Tool:** Next.js with custom configuration
- **Issues:**
  - Dependency conflicts (OpenTelemetry version mismatches)
  - Next.js configuration incompatibility (experimental.ppr requires canary version)
  - Missing tsx module in production build path
- **npm Package Manager Issues:** Peer dependency conflicts

**Major Dependency Conflicts:**
- `@opentelemetry/api-logs` version mismatch with `@vercel/otel`
- React 19 compatibility issues with older Radix UI components
- Zod version conflicts between packages

### 5. Type Checking ❌
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Tool:** TypeScript Compiler (tsc)
- **Issues:** Missing type definitions for D3 libraries and trusted-types
- **Total Errors:** 29 type definition errors
- **Categories:**
  - D3 library type definitions (28 errors)
  - Trusted-types library (1 error)

## Environment Configuration Issues

### Missing Environment Variables
- `POSTGRES_URL` (required for database migrations)
- Various API keys for external services
- Authentication secrets for test environment

### Docker Configuration
- Database container lifecycle management issues
- Network connectivity problems between application and test database
- Health check timing problems

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Dependency Conflicts**
   - Resolve OpenTelemetry version mismatches
   - Update Radix UI components for React 19 compatibility
   - Align Zod versions across packages

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Standardize environment variable naming (DATABASE_URL vs POSTGRES_URL)
   - Create proper test environment configuration
   - Set up required API keys for testing

3. **Database Test Infrastructure**
   - Fix container networking issues
   - Improve database readiness checks
   - Resolve tsx module dependencies

4. **Build Process**
   - Update Next.js configuration for stable version compatibility
   - Fix missing tsx modules
   - Resolve experimental feature dependencies

5. **Type Definitions**
   - Install missing D3 type packages
   - Add trusted-types type definitions
   - Review and update TypeScript configuration

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Test Infrastructure Stability**
   - Implement proper container orchestration
   - Add retry mechanisms for flaky tests
   - Improve test isolation and cleanup

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular dependency audits
   - Automated conflict detection
   - Version pinning strategy

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**
   - Environment-specific test configurations
   - Parallel test execution optimization
   - Better error reporting and debugging

## Known Limitations

1. **Test Environment Dependencies**
   - Requires Docker for database tests
   - Needs web server for E2E tests
   - External API dependencies for integration tests

2. **Development vs Production Configuration**
   - Environment variable differences
   - Different dependency requirements
   - Configuration incompatibilities

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Covered Areas
- Core AI utilities (text processing, tokenization)
- File search functionality
- Basic unit test coverage for critical components

### Uncovered Areas
- Database schema validation
- End-to-end user workflows
- Integration with external services
- Authentication and authorization flows
- UI component interactions

## Conclusion

The current test suite has a **20% pass rate** with only unit tests consistently passing. Critical infrastructure issues prevent database tests, E2E tests, and build verification from succeeding. The primary blockers are:

1. **Environment configuration inconsistencies**
2. **Dependency version conflicts**
3. **Infrastructure connectivity issues**
4. **Missing type definitions**

**Priority:** HIGH - Immediate attention required to establish a stable testing foundation before proceeding with additional feature development.
